## Descriptive analysis

### Introduction
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing categorical variables from a restaurant dataset using Python. The main objective is to understand the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines" within the dataset. By analyzing these variables, we aim to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or trends that can help in further data analysis and decision-making.

### Approach
* Data Exploration:

The project starts with loading and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure, including column names and data types.<br>
The focus is on categorical variables, and their distribution is examined to identify patterns.<br>

* Data Visualization:

Various visualization techniques such as bar plots are used to represent the distribution of categorical variables.<br>
Customizations like color coding, text formatting, and appropriate layout adjustments ensure clear and informative visual representations.<br>

* Analysis and Insights:

The distributions of key categorical variables are explored to gain insights into the dataset.<br>
Any anomalies, outliers, or unexpected trends are analyzed and addressed for better understanding.<br>

### Technologies Used
* Python for data manipulation and visualization.
* Libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data exploration and visualization.

### Results
* The visualizations provided help in understanding the distribution of categorical variables.

* Key insights are drawn regarding city distribution, cuisine preferences, and country codes, aiding further data analysis and decision-making.
* City code '1' have the most number of restaurants.
* New Delhi have the highest number of restaurants.
* North Indian cuisines are having the highest number of restaurants.

### Future Work
* Further exploration of additional variables may be carried out.
* More advanced data visualization techniques and statistical methods could be applied for deeper insights.
